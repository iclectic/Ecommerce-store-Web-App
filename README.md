# Ecommerce Store Website for Electronic Television Online Store

## Student Name: Ibim Mercy Miller Braide
## Student ID: 22166610
## Course: CMP7246 Web Application Development
## Assessment: D2

## Designed with the following:
- Hypertext Markup Language 
- Cascade Style Sheet
- Javascript
- Firebase
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Nota Bene:
- In a scenario where the web application crashes for any reason, especially if the `place order` button is clicked in the `checkout.html` page, kindly kill the terminal in the editor and run `npm start` in your terminal again.
- Code for an integrated Stripe payment platform can be found in the `server.js` and `checkout.js` files. The stripe files are not fully efficient and have been left that way, considering that a payment medium is not a requirement for this asssessment, to the best of my knowledge.
- To be on the safe site, it would still be best to install stripe as the checkout.js file, which also includes code for form validation is also affiliated to the `place order` button which is supposed to direct a user to a test stripe payment form.


## Aim of Project

- A user should be able to setup an account and login with the same details used for account registration.
- A user should be able to purchase item(s) after having logged in.
- A user should be able to add a product available for sale on the Ecommerce website.

## To run the ecommerce Website,kindly do the following:

- Extract the Zip file. 
- Open the extracted folder in a code editor
- Open a terminal in the code editor
- Run the codes below:
	
	```
	npm i firebase express.js bcrypt nodemon
	```

	```
	npm i stripe
	```
	
	```
	npm i start
	```
- Once the server has been launched your default web browser should host the website `locally on http://localhost:3000`
- The website can be accessed if it is not launched automatically on your default browser by visiting this address on your preferred browser `http://localhost:3000/index.html` 



Thank you!!!
