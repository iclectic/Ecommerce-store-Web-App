- More pages will be added subsequently.
- An aspect of the backend is functioning as one can sign in via the signup.html page considering that Firebase is used as a database.

- A user should be able to purchase item(s) after having logged in.
- A user should be able to add a product available for sale on the Ecommerce website.

- Open the extracted folder in a code editor
- Open a terminal in the code editor

	```
	npm i firebase express.js bcrypt nodemon
	```

	```
	npm i stripe
	```
	
	```
	npm i start
	```
- Once the server has been launched your default web browser should host the website `locally on http://localhost:3000`
- The website can be accessed if it is not launched automatically on your default browser by visiting this address on your preferred browser `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
